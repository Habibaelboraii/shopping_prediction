# shopping_prediction
This project focuses on predicting whether an online customer will make a purchase based on their browsing behavior. It uses Machine Learning algorithms (Random Forest) and applies data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation techniques
## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Feature selection and importance analysis
- Machine Learning models ( Random Forest)
- Model evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- ## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Habibaelboraii/shopping_prediction.git
2-Navigate to the project folder:
cd shopping_prediction
3-Install the required libraries:
pip install -r requirements.txt
4-Run the notebook:
jupyter notebook Project.ipynb
## Results
- Random Forest achieved 92% accuracy
